<h3>
	VERSION 2.0.0 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	20 SEP 2014
</h3>
       

<p>We are pleased to announce the next generation Brighter3D &#8211; the major 2.0 version.<br/>
	This new stage in Brighter3D&#8217;s evolution is based on several innovations and user experience improvements, which we hope will make your renderings a snap. Well, of course rendering is a quality game, but in this respect, we empowered you in this version with tools and algorithms which will truly make your efforts a breeze.</p>
	<p><strong>What&#8217;s up:</strong><br/>
	• A new, innovative, Unbiased Progressive Rendering Mode (UPRM) which allows you to render a preview in some seconds and then in iterative steps, a great image in minutes. You can then stop the rendering when the quality suits you for the purpose &#8211; a bright and smart way of rendering!<br/>
	• A completely new way of mapping a HDR Environment Map, which makes you feel like you are inside the scene. It matches your scene not only with Rotation, but also with Pan/Move.<br/>
	• Capability to load HDR/EXR images in Effects Studio (PRO Version only).<br/>
	• Capability to scale HDR maps (PRO Version only). An excellent way to make truly realistic renderings by matching scale of objects with the environment.<br/>
	• Lights now have Temperature in Kelvins. You can mix different temperature lights in a scene, giving a touch of authenticity and realism.<br/>
	• New Shadow Catcher material, which can fine-tune a shadow in a given scene at unprecedented realistic levels.<br/>
	• New Faces Rotation Tool. Previously, Brighter3D attempted to automatically fix wrongly oriented faces in Sketchup &#8211; an widespread known problem in Sketchup in conjunction with rendering programs. Now this tool is doing its job on a user voluntary command, giving full control to the final result in an efficient way.<br/>
	• Full direct animation from Sketchup Tabs, with Parametric Animation.<br/>
	Supports: <a href="http://www.regularpolygon.org/keyframe-animation">Keyframe Animation</a>, and any other animation plugin that can export to Tabs)<br/>
	• Tweaks in the user interface graphics and experience.<br/>
	• IMPORTANT! All these new gems are given as a free upgrade for all PRO Version users!</p>
	<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong><br/>
	As mentioned, from this version Brighter3D is no longer fixing wrong oriented faces on the fly, you will need to take care of that by yourself.</p>
