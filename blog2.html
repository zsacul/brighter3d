<p>I was guest speaker at the <a href="http://www.fmx.de">FMX 2016</a> conference, and I must say that was a great experience!</p>

	VERSION 2.6.1 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	18 APR 2016
</h3>

<p>Hi Brighter Renderers,</p>
<p>Great Spring, so new features and improvements came with it!</p>
<p>These improvements are from the Rendering Department, which is, in our<br/>
opinion, our strongest point.</p>
<p>First of all, for you the speed-lovers, we introduced a new Rendering<br/>
Method, namely <strong>Ambient Occlusion (AO)</strong>. This is a blazingly fast rendering<br/>
method, giving a rough idea of the rendering in some seconds (depending on<br/>
scene). This is by no means an usable rendering result (at least compared<br/>
to the other two, which we recommend), but it gives a fast feedback on the<br/>
scene. You just select the Method in Settings, and hit Render button,<br/>
no additional tweakings needed.<br/>
You can adjust rays lengths AO power in render window.</p>
<p>Another Rendering Effect which may improve on your presentation workflow,<br/>
is an interesting effect named <strong>Depth of Field (DOF)</strong>. You may have seen it<br/>
in many presentations. It gives authenticity to a rendering because in real<br/>
life, lenses do not reproduce the image as flat as a rendering does.<br/>
Use right mouse button to select focus point, and drag over DOF circle with right mouse button to adjust DOF power.</p>
<p>Also, great news for Architects. As a requested feature (and one we admit<br/>
is a useful one), Brighter3D now supports the <strong>Two Point Perspective</strong> from<br/>
SketchUp. As you may know, Architects may prefer to present their buildings<br/>
in a 2-point Perspective mode, because it may give a more realistic<br/>
appearance.<br/>
For a primer on perspectives, here&#8217;s a under 1 minute explanation:</p>

<p>And finally, for a smoother and higher quality renderings, we now support<br/>
<strong>full 32bit resolution per color channel</strong>. Now we speak high-end!</p>
<p>So, please enjoy a Brighter Spring! Ups, a Brighter3D Spring, that is.</p>
<p>Happy Renderings!</p>

	VERSION 2.5.1 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	24 DEC 2015
</h3>
<p><img src="./images/blog/xmas_brighter3d.jpg" alt="xmas card render" /></p>
<p>This update is a maintenance release.</p>
<p>We fixed some bugs and tweaked bits and pieces:<br/>
• file saving in JPEG was not working in some instances<br/>
• wrong transparency rendered when transparent background selected, on reflected surfaces<br/>
• minor GUI fixes and improvements<br/>
• on popular demand, now windows works as before for SketcUp version up to 2015, and for version 2016 it hides automatically &#8211; we are working for a solution</p>
<p>And, of course, we wish you some Merry renderings and Happy New Brighter Images in 2016!</p>

	VERSION 2.5.0 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	29 NOV 2015

<p>Hi Fellow Brighters!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve cooked some goodies for you to consume in this season approaching<br/>
times. We&#8217;ve polished some features and introduced a neat background<br/>
feature which will help a lot.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s say that BRDF function is unfortunately not so evident in it&#8217;s<br/>
usefulness. We encourage you to experiment and try to render on small<br/>
surfaces to see the real difference which gives authentic, realistic<br/>
results. BRDF is soundly implemented in Brighter3D, and working as<br/>
expected. However, you may have noticed that in the Materials Palette,<br/>
those with <strong>BRDF</strong> setting appeared in white (this was only a interface issue,<br/>
not anything wrong during rendering). We fixed that, and now they keep<br/>
their original <strong>&#8220;real&#8221; colour</strong>.</p>
<p>An <strong>installer bug</strong> annoyed us on certain situations &#8211; this bug didn&#8217;t<br/>
allowed to upgrade from previous versions; we fixed that.</p>
<p>We also improved <strong>artificial light sampling</strong> in some special cases.</p>
<p>This version is fully compatible with <strong>SketchUp 2016</strong>.</p>
<p>For those fortunate with a 4K monitor, it is now possible to maximize<br/>
windows on those monitors, for a splendid view of renderings and/or<br/>
Brighter use.</p>
<p>And finally, one great neat feature. You can now <strong>choose a background</strong> for<br/>
rendering, from various settings:<br/>
none - render is exporting as usual as a normal scene;<br/>
transparent - this is really useful when making product shots, the render<br/>
has a transparent background so you can then import the render in other<br/>
image manipulation programs for further editing; this setting only outputs<br/>
PNG files;<br/>
- daylight sun and sky - obviously this takes into consideration SketchUp's<br/>
appropiate settings;<br/>
- HDR map - you can put your HDR map of choice for further fine tuning,<br/>
like lighting, scenery, optical effects etc.;</p>
<p>Not to mention (again), all these with the fastest, brightest lighting<br/>
speed of rendering so Brighter3D-ish!</p>
<p>Happy renderings and see you soon.</p>
