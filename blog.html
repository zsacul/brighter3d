Hi  Brighters!<br /><br />
This time just a small update,
we made revoking and activating license even simpler (now you can do that by simple button click).<br /><br />
Second change is instant refresh button, now when you change camera view and press refresh button in render window (while render started), new view rendering will start immediately.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

	<br />
		Hi  Brighters!

		<p>Version 3.1.1 Brighter3D brings new possibilities.<br /><br />
		First all we added support for PBR textures, which increases rendering quality by an order  of magnitude. <br /><br />
		<br /><br />
		Now You can use map such as:<br />
		
		<strong>diffuse</strong> - base color input<br />
		<strong>normal</strong> - determined the number of dents and bumps on objects has<br />
		<strong>specular</strong> - defines an object’s shininess by using a grayscale map<br />
		<strong>roughness</strong> - works similarly to the glossiness in the specular workflow<br />
		<strong>ambient occlusion</strong> - local object shading<br />
		<br />
		You can select one texture and press the auto button to <strong>automatically</strong> get others from the same directory.</p>
	<p>
		We rewritten the way <strong>roughness parameter</strong> is handled (you get a bit of visually pleasing blue noise at the beginning) and it converges faster.<br />
		We updated raytracing engine to the latest version, that makes Brighter3D even faster then before.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For Your convenience, we've added a new "Scene Tools..." Submenu that allows You to:<br />
		- change all SketchUp transparent materials into default Brighter3D glass material<br />
		- remove all artificial lights from the stage<br />
		- remove all portals from the scene<br />
		- add fill light behind the camera<br />
		- remove fill light added by previous option<br />
		<br />
		Believe, some of these options make it easier to use the plugin - everything for You!
	</p>	
		
 	<p>
		Share Your 360 projects with others thanks to the latest version of Brighter3D! We introduced metadata to rendered 360 images, 
		 which results in better recognition in social media.
		
		Also, we added better anti aliasing with <strong>light edges</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Until next, we wish You a pleasant and fruitful work with the new version of Brighter3d!

	VERSION 3.0.3 RELEASED (64 BIT)<br />
	25 MAR 2019
</h3>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/brighter3d_render_360_camera.jpg" alt="" /></span>	

	Hi Brighters!
	<br />
	<p>Long time no see, BUT we were totally absorbed for a major overhaul and we
	managed to improve Brighter3D's engine from the ground-up, with better
	performance, faster and more accurate renderings, and improved
	functionality. We listened from users' needs. We totally bang it, and now
	we deliver the new Brighter3D version 3.0.3.</p>
	
  <p>So, are you happy with <b>Sketchup 2019</b>? We are, so we prepared Brighter3d for
	full <b>compatibility</b> with this latest version.</p>
	
  <p>With this new engine, this and all future versions are <b>64bit only</b>, giving
	users the opportunity to use all available computer memory for a seamless
	rendering experience.</p>
	
  <p>We finally delivered a much-sought after feature: an impressive <b>360 degrees
	rendering</b>, for online and VR use cases. The results are awesome, please do
	check this gem and delight yourself!</p>
	
  <p>Moreover, we greatly improved the rendering engine, with a boosted super
	<b>fast export of the scene</b>, caching textures and thus instant re-renderings
	after a view change.</p>
	
  <p>On the render screen, there is a <b>Refresh button</b> which will instantly
	re-render the scene without reexporting geometry and textures, after any
	view change.</p>
	
  <p>For some heavy-lifters out there, now you can prepare several views of the
	same scene, and then chain-render them one after each other overnight, with
	same settings. No more wasted time! (Not that you would waste time, anyway,
	with our super-fast new engine! :) )</p>
	
  <p>On the administrative side of things, we now allow a more <b>flexible license
	policy</b>, so now you can revoke a license from a computer, and re-enable it
	on another one, at will.</p>
	
  <p>All in all, we strive to brighten our Brighter3D, and we hope you will
	fully enjoy our work!</p>
	
  <p>Until next, we wish you a happy 2019 spring and, of course, happy
	renderings!</p>

<h3>
	VERSION 2.8.1 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	10 SEP 2018
</h3>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/blog/brighter3d_metals_new_materials-600x338.png" alt="" /></span>		
	<p>Hello Brighters!</p>
	<p>Brighter3D keeps on moving forward, and with the <strong>new 2.8.1 release</strong> that&#8217;s now available for download you&#8217;ll find a few new functionalities, fixes and optimizations that&#8217;ll make using the plugin more efficiently.</p>
	<p>First of all, we prepared Brighter3D for the <strong>Sketchup 2018 PRO </strong>release. Unfortunately Trimble decided to not continue MAKE version, but you can still use <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/download/all">SketchUp 2017 MAKE</a> for free.<br />
	We tested &amp; optimised the plugin for the new version, but if you find any possible glitch, please get back to us and we&#8217;ll fix things.</p>
	<p>Also, one of the improved functionalities is the capability of <strong>reversing </strong><strong>all selected faces</strong> with a single touch of the Reverse Faces Button form the Brighter3D Toolbar. Previously this was possible only one by one. Reversing is done preserving the material.</p>
	<p>For any user of a rendering plugin, reversing faces (a regular problem in rendering world) is a real pain, and our functionality increases the workflow&#8217;s efficiency. Also, reversing faces is not only useful for rendering purposes. Our plugin can be used for this task unrelated to any rendering job &#8211; yes, you are welcome.</p>
	<p>We also made a small improvement in interface UX. Namely, the <strong>Play/Render </strong><strong>Button</strong> now reflects the <strong>status of the rendering process</strong>. As you may know already, Brighter3D can render in the background while you work &#8211; an awesome productivity feature. Previously, you couldn&#8217;t tell if Brighter renders or not from within the Sketchup&#8217;s working window, for that you had to press Play/Render and see if there is a render process running. Now, if this Button looks pressed, that means Brighter3D is crunching lights. If in normal state, it does not.</p>
	<p>We remind you that rendering in the background also allows excellent efficiency for when tweaking materials and their properties, because in the Material Editor Window, you can live preview any change in material settings &#8211; a feature only available when Rendering is running.</p>
	<p>We also added <strong>metal materials</strong>, as now you can turn on metal checkbox and selected color will become the color of the reflection.<br />
	You can download sample scene (rendered image above) <a href="http://www.brighter3d.com/downloads/metals.skp">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Last but not least, this 2.8.1 version is the last one which has both 32bit and 64bit versions. <strong>All future versions will be released as 64bit only</strong>, thus allowing for truly superb performance: use of whole memory for processing, for new features such as super realistic materials (based mainly on separate textures as albedo, reflectance and roughness).<br />
	We estimate that the impact of releasing only for 64bit is minimal, since in an rendering environment, 64bit systems are really ubiquitous.<br />
	<br />
	Until next, please enjoy Brighter3D!

<h3>
	VERSION 2.7.2 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	23 APR 2017
</h3>
<p>Hi fellow Brighters!</p>
<p>Spring comes with some speedup and improvements.</p>
<p>Brighter3D version 2.7.2 has now an <strong>updated</strong> and refined <strong>raytracing core<br />
engine</strong>, with latest algorithms optimised with i-series processors, among<br />
others. Roughly, depending on scene of course, the speedup is more than<br />
10%. We also improved scenes exporting time.</p>
<p>Also, for the graphic designers out there, now is possible to save the<br />
render in <strong>96 bit TIFF</strong> file. This is a very useful feature &#8211; now you can include<br />
renders in high end graphic design software and printed applications.<br />
You can also post process your renders in <strong><a href="https://lightroom.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom</a></strong><br />
or similar software. </p>
<p>And finally, if you know the awesome Sketchup plugin <strong><a href="http://regular-polygon.com/keyframe-animation/" target="_blank">KeyFrame Animation</a></strong>,<br />
Brighter 3D is now supporting it. You can now create full-fledged animations<br />
with rendered images within Brighter3D, creating stunning movies for<br />
presentations or designs.</p>
<p>Until next, we wish you a nice spring and happy renders.<br />

<h3>
	VERSION 2.7.0 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	19 NOV 2016
</h3>
<p><span class="image left"><a href="images/blog/sphereV.jpg"><img src="images/blog/sphereV-600x338.jpg" alt="Sphere render mini" /></a></span>

<p>The amazing 2017 version of Sketchup is officially out, and we are here to announce you our move, too.</p>
<p>So, we made <strong>Brighter3D</strong> compatible with <strong>Sketchup 2017</strong>, testing it as thorough as we can, but please send us any bug you may encounter and we&#8217;ll surely do our best to fix it.</p>
<p>As for the goodies department, we modified our algorithms and we <strong>improved the caching of HDR</strong> during loading, and for mipmap generation.</p>
<p>This results in a really <strong>faster HDR rendering</strong>. Another tweak we implemented is that from now on, you can switch off smooth camera animation path, if you would like to do so during an animation.</p>
<p>As always, we keep improving Brighter3D and we will soon launch a new version with more productivity tools.</p>
<p>Happy rendering!</p>

<h3>
	VERSION 2.6.2 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	23 MAY 2016
</h3>

</p>
<p>Hi Brighter Renderers!</p>
<p>Mighty Power has come in this new 2.6.2 version of Brighter3D.</p>
<p>We thoroughly and recursively increased performance of our rendering<br />
algorithms, especially when rendering with HDR and texture-intensive<br />
scenes. So, after an initial first render of the scene, we <strong>cache</strong> the<br />
results of the <strong>HDR and Sun</strong>, and the subsequent scene rendering doesn&#8217;t need<br />
reinitialization, so it&#8217;s faster than ever! Of course, for this you should<br />
not change the HDR angle and the Sun Settings. When you often make many<br />
different angle views renderings with the same settings, this is a huge<br />
time-saver. Although TtR (Time to Render) varies greatly with each scene,<br />
we estimate a cut in half of TtR.</p>
<p>Also, you can now <strong>rotate the HDR Map</strong>, for tweaking the final<br />
scene rendering.</p>
<p>And finally, some great options for when a special presentation of a<br />
product or a scene need additional post production in graphics programs<br />
such as Photoshop. You can now have the <strong>choice</strong> of saving the scene/object<br />
and the <strong>background/reflection selectively</strong>. So, if you choose the background<br />
to be transparent, with a HDR set, you can still opt for the HDR reflection<br />
to be rendered on objects (or not), so when reuniting scene and tweaked<br />
background, all the things to look realistic. Same applies to Sun/Sky, too.<br />
Cool!</p>
<p>We also <strong>fixed</strong> an important <strong>bug</strong> related to inconsistent <strong>HDR lighting.</strong> Now<br />
it&#8217;s 100% pure physics.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for today. Stay tuned for more performance improvements in the<br />
near future.</p>
<p>Happy Renderings!</p>
