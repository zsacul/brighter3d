	<p>Hello Brighters!</p>
	<p>Brighter3D keeps on moving forward, and with the <strong>new 2.8.1 release</strong> that&#8217;s now available for download you&#8217;ll find a few new functionalities, fixes and optimizations that&#8217;ll make using the plugin more efficiently.</p>
	<p>First of all, we prepared Brighter3D for the <strong>Sketchup 2018 PRO </strong>release. Unfortunately Trimble decided to not continue MAKE version, but you can still use <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/download/all">SketchUp 2017 MAKE</a> for free.<br />
	We tested &amp; optimised the plugin for the new version, but if you find any possible glitch, please get back to us and we&#8217;ll fix things.</p>
	<p>Also, one of the improved functionalities is the capability of <strong>reversing </strong><strong>all selected faces</strong> with a single touch of the Reverse Faces Button form the Brighter3D Toolbar. Previously this was possible only one by one. Reversing is done preserving the material.</p>
	<p>For any user of a rendering plugin, reversing faces (a regular problem in rendering world) is a real pain, and our functionality increases the workflow&#8217;s efficiency. Also, reversing faces is not only useful for rendering purposes. Our plugin can be used for this task unrelated to any rendering job &#8211; yes, you are welcome.</p>
	<p>We also made a small improvement in interface UX. Namely, the <strong>Play/Render </strong><strong>Button</strong> now reflects the <strong>status of the rendering process</strong>. As you may know already, Brighter3D can render in the background while you work &#8211; an awesome productivity feature. Previously, you couldn&#8217;t tell if Brighter renders or not from within the Sketchup&#8217;s working window, for that you had to press Play/Render and see if there is a render process running. Now, if this Button looks pressed, that means Brighter3D is crunching lights. If in normal state, it does not.</p>
	<p>We remind you that rendering in the background also allows excellent efficiency for when tweaking materials and their properties, because in the Material Editor Window, you can live preview any change in material settings &#8211; a feature only available when Rendering is running.</p>
	<p>We also added <strong>metal materials</strong>, as now you can turn on metal checkbox and selected color will become the color of the reflection.<br />
	You can download sample scene (rendered image above) <a href="http://www.brighter3d.com/downloads/metals.skp">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Last but not least, this 2.8.1 version is the last one which has both 32bit and 64bit versions. <strong>All future versions will be released as 64bit only</strong>, thus allowing for truly superb performance: use of whole memory for processing, for new features such as super realistic materials (based mainly on separate textures as albedo, reflectance and roughness).<br />
	We estimate that the impact of releasing only for 64bit is minimal, since in an rendering environment, 64bit systems are really ubiquitous.<br />
	<br />
	Until next, please enjoy Brighter3D!

	VERSION 2.7.2 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	23 APR 2017
</h3>
<p>Hi fellow Brighters!</p>
<p>Spring comes with some speedup and improvements.</p>
<p>Brighter3D version 2.7.2 has now an <strong>updated</strong> and refined <strong>raytracing core<br />
engine</strong>, with latest algorithms optimised with i-series processors, among<br />
others. Roughly, depending on scene of course, the speedup is more than<br />
10%. We also improved scenes exporting time.</p>
<p>Also, for the graphic designers out there, now is possible to save the<br />
render in <strong>96 bit TIFF</strong> file. This is a very useful feature &#8211; now you can include<br />
renders in high end graphic design software and printed applications.<br />
You can also post process your renders in <strong><a href="https://lightroom.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom</a></strong><br />
or similar software. </p>
<p>And finally, if you know the awesome Sketchup plugin <strong><a href="http://regular-polygon.com/keyframe-animation/" target="_blank">KeyFrame Animation</a></strong>,<br />
Brighter 3D is now supporting it. You can now create full-fledged animations<br />
with rendered images within Brighter3D, creating stunning movies for<br />
presentations or designs.</p>
<p>Until next, we wish you a nice spring and happy renders.<br />

	VERSION 2.7.0 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />

<p>The amazing 2017 version of Sketchup is officially out, and we are here to announce you our move, too.</p>
<p>So, we made <strong>Brighter3D</strong> compatible with <strong>Sketchup 2017</strong>, testing it as thorough as we can, but please send us any bug you may encounter and we&#8217;ll surely do our best to fix it.</p>
<p>As for the goodies department, we modified our algorithms and we <strong>improved the caching of HDR</strong> during loading, and for mipmap generation.</p>
<p>This results in a really <strong>faster HDR rendering</strong>. Another tweak we implemented is that from now on, you can switch off smooth camera animation path, if you would like to do so during an animation.</p>
<p>As always, we keep improving Brighter3D and we will soon launch a new version with more productivity tools.</p>
<p>Happy rendering!</p>

<h3>
	VERSION 2.6.2 RELEASED (64/32 BIT)<br />
	23 MAY 2016
</h3>

<p>Hi Brighter Renderers!</p>
<p>Mighty Power has come in this new 2.6.2 version of Brighter3D.</p>
<p>We thoroughly and recursively increased performance of our rendering<br />
algorithms, especially when rendering with HDR and texture-intensive<br />
scenes. So, after an initial first render of the scene, we <strong>cache</strong> the<br />
results of the <strong>HDR and Sun</strong>, and the subsequent scene rendering doesn&#8217;t need<br />
reinitialization, so it&#8217;s faster than ever! Of course, for this you should<br />
not change the HDR angle and the Sun Settings. When you often make many<br />
different angle views renderings with the same settings, this is a huge<br />
time-saver. Although TtR (Time to Render) varies greatly with each scene,<br />
we estimate a cut in half of TtR.</p>
<p>Also, you can now <strong>rotate the HDR Map</strong>, for tweaking the final<br />
scene rendering.</p>
<p>And finally, some great options for when a special presentation of a<br />
product or a scene need additional post production in graphics programs<br />
such as Photoshop. You can now have the <strong>choice</strong> of saving the scene/object<br />
and the <strong>background/reflection selectively</strong>. So, if you choose the background<br />
to be transparent, with a HDR set, you can still opt for the HDR reflection<br />
to be rendered on objects (or not), so when reuniting scene and tweaked<br />
background, all the things to look realistic. Same applies to Sun/Sky, too.<br />
Cool!</p>
<p>We also <strong>fixed</strong> an important <strong>bug</strong> related to inconsistent <strong>HDR lighting.</strong> Now<br />
it&#8217;s 100% pure physics.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for today. Stay tuned for more performance improvements in the<br />
near future.</p>
<p>Happy Renderings!</p>
